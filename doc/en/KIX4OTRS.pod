=head1 General

This extensions package provides several new and many improved functions for OTRS and OTRS::ITSM. If you have no OTRS::ITSM installed you can also use this installation package. It requires KIXCore to be already installed.

The detailed description of all extensions can be found in the documentation for this pacakge. You may download it in the package manager after installation of KIX4OTRS or from our website. Below you find the table of contents for this documentation.

=head1 Installation

The installation of KIX4OTRS requires that the user which installs the packer (i.e. webserver user) has got write permissions on file Config.pm and apache2-perl-startup.pl. If this is not the case, the installation will fail. You should then try to run following commands (under the correspondig user) in order to get this extension running:

    "bin/kix.ManageMultipleCustomPackages.pl -a Register -n KIX4OTRS -p 0100"
    "bin/kix.ManageMultipleCustomPackages.pl -a Register -n KIX4OTRSITSMCore -p 0110"
    "bin/kix.ManageMultipleCustomPackages.pl -a Register -n KIX4OTRSITSMConfigManagement -p 0120"
    "bin/kix.ManageMultipleCustomPackages.pl -a Register -n KIX4OTRSITSMIncidentProblem -p 0130"

After the installation you should delete your OTRS-cache and rebuild your configuration before you continue the use of this OTRS installation.

    "bin/otrs.DeleteCache.pl"
    "bin/otrs.RebuildConfig.pl"

If you are using OTRS with modperl, the webserver must be restarted as well. Please ensure that the apache2-perl-startup.pl script has been modifed and is in use.
